# HearthstoneSimulator

A simulator for the digital card game known as Hearthstone. I wrote this because I thought it would be a challenging software design exercise (how do card effects work?). It was!

See docs folder for the following documentation:

- code_explanation.md: basic overview of how the code works
- to_do.md: to do list
- software_design_issues.md: current questions/issues I am examining with the code base
